# FPOS - Hourly Sales Report
### A TRUE Point-of-Sale Hourly Sales Report

Currently in the FPOS system hourly sales reports show each hour's sales based upon sale completion, i.e. when a server collects payment and closes the sale. This can create wide variances in actual hourly sales and display certain time ranges as BUSY when they are more or less winding down. 

This report corrects this issue by displaying hourly sales based upon when the item was initially rung into the POS system, i.e. the TRUE purchased time.
